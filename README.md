# acmesmith-verisign

This gem is a plugin for [Acmesmith](https://github.com/sorah/acmesmith) and implements an automated `dns-01` challenge responder using Verisign MDNS REST API.

With this plugin and Acmesmith, you can automate and authorize your domain hosted on [Verisign MDNS Portal](https://mdns.verisign.com/mdns-web/login.xhtml) and request TLS certificates for the domains against [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and other CAs supporting the ACME protocol.

Please consider that Verisign API is closed by default and should be whitelist per IP address by opening a support case at mdnshelp@verisign.com.
